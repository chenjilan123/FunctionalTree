2. Visual Studio: Solution Explorer, Class View, Object Browser.
3. QQ: User Group.
4. Windows File System.



Careful:
1. Setting the TreeNode.Checked property from within the BeforeCheck or 
	AfterCheck event causes the event to be raised multiple times and can result in unexpected behavior.

//How to optimize
//https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.control.recreatehandle?view=netframework-4.7.2
2. When setting the CheckBoxes, Scrollable, ImageIndex, and SelectedImageIndex properties at run time, 
	the TreeView handle is recreated (see Control.RecreateHandle) to update the control's appearance. 
	This causes all tree nodes to be collapsed, except for the selected TreeNode.
